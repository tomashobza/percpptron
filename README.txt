This is a project where I implement the perceptron in C++. The main goals are two: 1. Prevent
brainrot caused by the overuse of LLMs, 2. learn and *internalize* how the perceptron works.
This is not an attempt to make the most efficient implementation of this very basic ML algorithm,
it's just a funny side project, a challenge. I want to start with the perceptron and then
use it to create a simple neural network - an MLP. Very basic, but very fun.
