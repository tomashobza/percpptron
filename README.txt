This is a project where I implement the perceptron in C++. The main goals are two: 1. Prevent
brainrot caused by the overuse of LLMs, 2. learn and *internalize* how the perceptron works.
This is not an attempt to make the most efficient implementation of this very basic ML algorithm,
it's just a funny side project, a challenge. I want to start with the perceptron and then
use it to create a simple neural network - an MLP. Very basic, but very fun.

For this project I have these rules:

1. I can use LLMs only as a "smarter documentation" - no code pasting.
2. I have to fully understand every statement written.
3. I have to implement MATMUL and other primitives myself - no C++ magic.

I would do this in C purely, but I want to leverage overloading of operators for the MATMUL
implementation along with some time-saving with regards to memory management. (Love it or hate
it, but OOP is a pretty simple model for saving youself the hassle.)
